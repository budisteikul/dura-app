<p>These terms and conditions contain legal obligations and we encourage you to read through them carefully. Unless otherwise stated, any purchases made through VertikalTrip.com are subject to these terms and conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1. Our contract</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All bookings are made with VertikalTrip.com (us/we). By making a booking, the traveller/guest (you) is deemed to have agreed to these terms and conditions on behalf of all individuals included in the booking. The services to be provided are those in your booking confirmation invoice. No alterations or variations to these terms and conditions are in effect unless made in writing by and under the authority of VertikalTrip.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Pricing and payments</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.1 Pricing</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i. Prices and exchange rates &mdash; Prices are correct at the time of quoting, converted at the prevailing foreign exchange rate as set by VertikalTrip.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ii. Price changes &mdash; The prices appearing on the website are the current rates and can change without notice. Once a traveller has booked through VertikalTrip.com, the traveller will not be required to pay any difference in the event of a price increase. VertikalTrip.com will not refund the balance of any price reduction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>iii. Child rate &mdash; Our child rates apply at the time of the tour, not the time of booking. Proof of age must be available for inspection on the day of travel. If a traveller is identified as not qualifying for a child price (if a child price is available for the tour), the traveller will be required to provide the balance of difference between the adult rate and child rate for the tour before being permitted to start the trip.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>iv. Per person &mdash; All prices listed are on a per traveller basis unless otherwise stated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>vi. Exclusions &mdash; Prices do not include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Tips and gratuities &mdash; If you are happy with the services provided by your local guides and drivers, a tip &mdash; though not compulsory &mdash; is appropriate. While it may not be customary to you, it is of great significance to the people who will take care of you during your travels, inspires excellent service, and is an entrenched feature of the tourism industry across many destinations. Please consider this when budgeting for your extra expenses on your tour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>b) Items of a personal nature &mdash; These may include snacks, meals, and drinks not outlined as an inclusion in the inclusions section of the tour description.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>c) Baggage and personal insurance &mdash; It is highly recommended that each traveller obtains adequate insurance for their travels</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>d) Local taxes and fees &mdash; Unless otherwise stated, the price does not include any local taxes or fees, including foreign departure, security, port charges, park fees, customs, immigration, agricultural, passenger-facility charges, or international transportation tax.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>2.2 Payment</p>
<p>a) VertikalTrip.com use PayPal as payment gateway to securely transact payments using their respective payment systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>b) Payment due &mdash; Without exception full payment is required at the time of booking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Cancellations/no-shows and amendments to bookings</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.1 Cancellations by the traveller</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Cancellation fees &ndash; Cancellation fees may apply to any cancellations by the traveller of a service provided by VertikalTrip.com. Some venues and local organisers cannot accept cancellations or changes to your booking once it has been confirmed. In the event of cancellations by the traveller, please refer to &ldquo;Cancellation Policy&rdquo; as indicated on each individual tour, experience or activity page within the VertikalTrip.com website. If there is no cancellation policy stated, the cancellation policy is as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i. Cancellations made more than 7 working days prior to travel receive a full refund;</p>
<p>ii. Cancellations made more than 48 hours prior to travel receive a 50% refund;</p>
<p>iii. Cancellations made 48 hours or less prior to travel require the traveller to pay for the tour in full, and no refund will be issued.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>b) Unused portions of tours &ndash; No refund is provided for any unused portion of a tour, including the entire tour in the event a traveller does not commence at the designated start point of the tour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.2 Cancellations by VertikalTrip or our Partners</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We or the service provider may cancel a tour at any time prior to departure if, due to terrorism, natural disasters, political instability, or other external events it is not viable for us to operate the planned itinerary. If we cancel your tour, you can transfer amounts paid to an alternate departure date or, alternatively, receive a full refund. In circumstances where the cancellation is due to external events outside our reasonable control, refunds will be less any unrecoverable costs. We are not responsible for any incidental expenses you may have incurred as a result of your booking, including but not limited to visas, vaccinations, travel insurance, or non-refundable flights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.3 Amendments to bookings by the traveller</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you to amend an existing booking, you must content your VertikalTrip immediately on guide@vertikaltrip.com. An amendment fee may be charged. If the tour is unavailable for the changed date and you wish to cancel, cancellation charges may apply (please refer to &ldquo;T&amp;C&rsquo;s&rdquo; section 3.1 Cancellations by the traveller).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. Confirmation</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Confirmation &mdash; Upon receipt of full payment, the partner/tour operator will issue a voucher via email for the booked tour.</p>
<p>b) Voucher (if applicable)&nbsp;&mdash; The lead traveller must present the original voucher issued by the partner at the start of the tour. VertikalTrip partners reserve the right to refuse service to any travellers not able to provide their voucher to their guide at the beginning of the tour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5. Your VertikalTrip Adventure</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.1 Traveller confirmation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommend the lead traveller contact the local VertikalTrip Partner 24 hours prior to the start of their tour to confirm the tour departure. The local partner&rsquo;s contact information is available on the voucher provided following confirmation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.2 Timeliness</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Travellers must adhere to the start time set out in the product information on their voucher. In the event a traveller is not at the designated starting point within 15 minutes of the start time provided, VertikalTrip and the local VertikalTrip Partner will consider the traveller to be a &ldquo;no show&rdquo; and the tour will start without them and no refund will be provided. The following start point(s) are outlined in the tour information and on the confirmation voucher:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Pick-up &mdash; If a pick-up is included in the tour, the times the service will be provided are listed in the product information and on the voucher (for example, 8.30am to 9.00am). The traveller should wait in the lobby of their pick-up point during the designated pick-up times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>b) Meeting point &mdash; If a meeting point is set for the tour, one time will be set as the start time (for example, 8.30am). The traveller should be waiting at the designated start point at the designated start time. It is recommended that you arrive at least 10 minutes prior to the start of the tour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.3 Your responsibility</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The traveller making the booking is responsible for their own and their party&rsquo;s actions. If VertikalTrip.com or the local VertikalTrip Partner deems you or your party&rsquo;s actions to cause danger to other travellers or our staff, to intervene with other clients&rsquo; enjoyment of the trip, or to be offensive to the local communities and cultures, VertikalTrip.com and the local VertikalTrip Partner reserve the right to remove you from the tour immediately. No refund will be supplied. You must at all times comply with the laws, customs, foreign exchange, and drug regulations of all countries visited, and you also agree to travel in accordance with our responsible travel guidelines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.4 Acceptance of risk</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You acknowledge that your tour may involve a degree of personal risk. You may be visiting places where the political, cultural, and geographical attributes present dangers and physical challenges greater than those present in your daily life. It is your own responsibility to acquaint yourself with all possible relevant travel information. You acknowledge that your decision to travel is made in light of consideration of this information and you accept that you are aware of the personal risks&rsquo; attendant upon such travel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.5 Conditions of suppliers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The services which make up your booking are provided by independent suppliers. Those suppliers provide these services in accordance with their own terms and conditions which will form part of your contract with us. Some of these terms and conditions may limit or exclude the supplier&rsquo;s liability to you, usually in accordance with applicable International Conventions. Copies of the relevant parts of these terms and conditions are normally available on request from the supplier concerned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6. Information accuracy</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lead traveller is responsible for providing accurate information during the booking process. VertikalTrip.com and VertikalTrip partners reserve the right to cancel any bookings if inaccurate information is provided, including (but not exclusive to):</p>
<p><br />a) Traveller name(s)</p>
<p>b) Hotel (pick-up) details</p>
<p>c) Email address</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7. Age and health requirements</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Age requirements &mdash; All travellers under the age of 18 must be accompanied by a legal guardian, or in lieu of a legal guardian, by an escort over the age of 18, appointed by their legal guardian. The legal guardian or their designee will be responsible for the traveller under the age of 18. While many of our tours permit all ages, the minimum age requirements may vary with tours. Please see the tour description to check whether a tour is child friendly. For tours featuring alcohol, travellers may be required to show proof of age of majority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>b) Health requirements &mdash; Some trips can be physically demanding, and travellers must ensure that they are suitably fit to allow participation. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are physically fit to participate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>8. Travel insurance</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a requirement that all travellers booking a VertikalTrip.com adventure, tour or activity have valid and comprehensive travel insurance. Neither VertikalTrip.com nor the VertikalTrip Partner can be held responsible for any liability, expenses, or losses you incur as a result of being inadequately insured. We strongly recommend that at the time of booking a comprehensive travel insurance policy is purchased.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>9. Passports and visas</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unless travelling domestically, travellers must carry a valid passport and have obtained the appropriate visas when travelling with VertikalTrip.com and the local VertikalTrip Partners. Please ensure your passport is valid for 6 months beyond the duration of the trip. It is the traveller&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure that you are in possession of the correct visas for your holiday. VertikalTrip.com and the local VertikalTrip Partners cannot accept responsibility if you are refused entry to a country because you lack the correct visa documentation.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>10. Complaints</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should you have a complaint about your VertikalTrip.com booking, we urge you to discuss this at the time with the local VertikalTrip Partner. In the event you wish to complain further, please contact VertikalTrip.com in writing within 30 days of travel. Complaints received outside this timeframe will not be considered.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>11. Photos and marketing</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You consent to us and VertikalTrip Partners using images of you taken during the tour for advertising and promotional purposes in any medium we choose. You grant us a perpetual, royalty-free, worldwide, irrevocable licence to use such images for publicity and promotional purposes.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>12. Disclaimers and limitations of liability</strong></p>

<p>c) VertikalTrip.com maintains information that is accurate to the best of our knowledge; however, does not warrant that content and information provided on VertikalTrip.com website will be without error and that functionality of the websites uninterrupted or without error.</p>
<p>d) VertikalTrip.com and VertikalTrip Partners will not accept responsibility or liability for any traveller who contravenes any law or regulation of any country visited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>13. Account Registration</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) For Operators &ndash; Tour operators that wish to take advantage of VertikalTrip.com services and sell their tours on the VertikalTrip Global Marketplace need to first submit their application via the Partners sign up form. VertikalTrip.com reviews all sign up requests and assesses the compatibility of the tour operators&rsquo; product with the VertikalTrip platform. Upon reviewing the sign up request the VertikalTrip.com team informs the operator whether or not working together is possible. VertikalTrip.com reserves the right to decline the application at this stage, or any other, stage.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>14. Tour Listings</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Once a contract has been agreed between both parties, Partners can create listings via Bokun, powered by TripAdvisor (a 3rd party booking engine). To this end, you will be asked a variety of questions about the Tour to be listed, including, but not limited to, the location, capacity, itinerary, features, availability of the Tour and pricing and related rules.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>b) Partners working with VertikalTrip.com are responsible for making sure that their tour listings on Bokun.io platform are up to date. If any tours are removed by the partner on VertikalTrip&rsquo;s contract, the partner must inform VertikalTrip immediately via the Bokun contract management tool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>c) Other Members will be able to book your Tour based upon the information provided in your Listing. You acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for any and all Listings you post. Accordingly, you represent and warrant that any Listing you post and the booking of, (i) will not breach any agreements you have entered into with any third parties (such as any agreements with or rules of employers or local tourism agencies) and (ii) will (a) be in compliance with all applicable laws, Tax requirements, and rules and regulations that may apply to any Tour included in a Listing you post, including, but not limited to, tourism, tour guide licensing laws, and other laws governing events and tours of public spaces and other venues and (b) not conflict with the rights of third parties. Please note that VertikalTrip.com assumes no responsibility for a Partners&rsquo; compliance with any applicable laws, rules and regulations. VertikalTrip.com reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable access to any Listing for any reason, including Listings that VertikalTrip.com, in its sole discretion, considers to be objectionable for any reason, in violation of these Terms or otherwise harmful to the Services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>d) You understand and agree that VertikalTrip.com does not act as an insurer or as a contracting agent for you as an Operator. If a Traveller requests a booking of your Tour and participates in your Tour, any agreement you enter into with such Traveller is between you and the Traveller and VertikalTrip.com is not a party thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, VertikalTrip.com serves as the limited authorised agent of the Operator for the purpose of accepting payments from the Traveller on behalf of the Operator and is responsible for transmitting such payments to the Operator, subject to these Terms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>15. International/overseas orders</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All prices shown on VertikalTrip&rsquo;s website are in USD&rsquo;s and all transactions are conducted in USD&rsquo;s. If your credit/debit card account is in a currency other than USD, you may also be subject to a foreign currency transaction fee. Please consult your bank or credit card provider if you are unsure. We are not responsible for the exchange rate or any charges your bank or issuing credit card company may charge you.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>16. Tours and Experience descriptions, formats and durations</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Tour and experience descriptions, format and timings given on VertikalTrip.com website and in any other literature are only intended to present a general idea of the tour or experience and shall not be considered binding. Photographs are for illustrative purposes only and do not form part of any contract between you and VertikalTrip.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>b) As VertikalTrip.com offers tours and experiences at a wide number of venues, details such as session lengths, itineraries, equipment used, and numbers of participants may vary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>c) Most tours or experiences will be &ldquo;open&rdquo; meaning that other members of the public will be taking part too. This could mean taking your turn with other members of the public.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>d) Delays, curtailments and breakdowns are not within VertikalTrip.com control, and therefore cannot be held liable if these should occur. Please note that we reserve the right to alter any part of the tour or experience where such an alteration has been imposed by the operator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>e) We cannot be held responsible for descriptions by or on any third party or agent sites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>f) Tours or experiences may occasionally be withdrawn for reasons outside of our control, and VertikalTrip.com cannot be held liable for any costs incurred as a result of this. Should this occur, you or your recipient may be offered the opportunity to exchange your voucher for one with the same face value. No refunds can be offered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Changes to these terms and conditions</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VertikalTrip.com may occasionally update its terms and conditions. When this is done, we will also revise the &lsquo;last updated&rsquo; date of its terms and conditions.</p>
